This directory contains the "tape" files for the EDSAC's subroutine
library and postmortem routines.  The subroutines are all from the
standard EDSAC library, as described in Part II of WWG.  The postmortem
routines are described in section 4.2 of the Tutorial Guide.

As the simulator does not provide all of the routines available at
Cambridge for the original machine, it is conceivable that more of
these will be added at a future date.  To that end, we provide the
following instructions on how to add, for example, the "tape" for
subroutine "X99" in the category "Xtra", which already contains 3
tapes:

    1.  Add a file named "X99.txt" to this directory, and add a
    corresponding entry in the "resources.qrc".

    2.  Find the "Xtras" category in the "catalog.ini" file.  Change
    the "num=3" line to "num=4".  Add the line

        s4=X99 - Extra function #99

    to the file.

When you next build the simulator, the new subroutine will be
available via both the "Library" menu and the "Subroutine Library"
tabs.

Complete Description of the "catalog.ini" File Format:

-- The first line of the file must be "[Categories]".  This is followed
by a "num=" line that specifies the number of category names that
follow.

-- Each category is represented by a line of the form "cn - name",
where 'n' is the category number, and 'name' is the category name.
The category numbers should be consecutive, starting with 1.

-- Immediately after the "num=" line is a "default=cn" name, where
'cn' is the category specifier as described in the next item.  This
category will be the initially selected tab in the "Subroutine
Library" window.

-- For each category, a section follows, in order of category number,
introduced by the category name in square brackets, followed by a
"num=" line specifying the number of routines in that category.

-- Each line specifying a routine begins with an 's' (for a subroutine
that can be inserted into a program) or 'f' (for a file that can be
loaded -- and run -- directly), followed by an item number and an
equals sign ('=').  These are followed by the routine name, a hyphen
('-') and a description of what the routine does.  The routine name
consists of a category prefix and serial number as described in Part II
of WWG.  As with category numbers, item numbers should be consecutive.
Currently, the 'f' code is used only for postmortem routines.

For all lines in this file, leading and trailing whitespace is ignored,
and all internal whitespace is reduced to a single space.  Blank lines
are ignored, as are "comment" lines, which begin with a '#'.

The current implementation does not check that category numbers and
item numbers within categories are consecutive, but this may change in
future.

Minimal example catalog.ini file:

      # Sample catalog.ini:
    [Categories]
    num=2
    c1=Checking
    c2=Division

    [Checking]
    num=2
    s1=C7 - Check function letters
    s2=C10 - Numerical check

    [Division]
    num=1
    s1=D6 - Division
